== Regulatory Requirements

=== Spectrum License Required


GSM operates in licensed frequency spectrum. As a result you may not
operate a BTS without having obtained a license from the regulatory
authority in the country you want to operate the BTS in.

Failure to acquire a proper spectrum license or failure to comply with
the terms of the license can lead to interference with public
communications networks, which not only may cause civil claims by the
operator of the interfered network, but is punishable as a crime under
most jurisdictions.

sysmocom and/or the authors of the Osmocom software disclaim any
responsibility for illegal / unlicensed use of its products.
