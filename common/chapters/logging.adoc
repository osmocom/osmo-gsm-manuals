== libosmocore Logging System


In any reasonably complex software it is important to understand how to
enable and configure logging in order to get a better insight into what
is happening, and to be able to follow the course of action.  We
therefore ask the reader to bear with us while we explain how the
logging subsystem works and how it is configured.

Most Osmocom Software (like `osmo-bts`, `osmo-bsc`, `osmo-nitb`,
`osmo-sgsn` and many others) uses the same common logging system.

This chapter describes the architecture and configuration of this common
logging system.

The logging system is composed of

* log targets (where to log),
* log categories (who is creating the log line),
* log levels (controlling the verbosity of logging), and
* log filters (filtering or suppressing certain messages).

All logging is done in human-readable ASCII-text.  The logging system is
configured by means of VTY commands that can either be entered
interactively, or read from a configuration file at process start time.

[[log_categories]]
=== Log categories

Each sub-system of the program in question typically logs its messages as a
different category, allowing fine-grained control over which log
messages you will or will not see.  For example, in OsmoBSC, there are
categories for the protocol layers `rsl`, `rr`, `mm`,
`cc` and many others.  To get a list of categories interactively
on the vty, type: `logging level ?`

[[log_levels]]
=== Log levels

For each of the log categories (see <<log_categories>>), you can set an independent log level,
controlling the level of verbosity.  Log levels include:

fatal::
	Fatal messages, causing abort and/or re-start of a process.
	This __shouldn't happen__.

error::
	An actual error has occurred, its cause  should be further
	investigated by the administrator.


notice::
	A noticeable event has occurred, which is not
	considered to be an error.

info::
	Some information about normal/regular system
	activity is provided.

debug::
	Verbose information about internal processing of the system,
	used for debugging purpose. This will log the most.

The log levels are inclusive, e.g. if you select __info__, then this
really means that all events with a level of at least __info__ will be
logged, i.e. including events of __notice__, __error__ and __fatal__.

So for example, in OsmoBSC, to set the log level of the Mobility
Management category to info, you can use the following command:
	`log level mm info`.

There is also a special command to set all categories as a one-off to a desired
log level. For example, to silence all messages but those logged as notice and
above issue the command: `log level set-all notice`

Afterwards you can adjust specific categories as usual.

A similar command is `log level force-all <level>` which causes all categories
to behave as if set to log level <level> until the command is reverted with
`no log level force-all` after which the individually-configured log levels will
again take effect. The difference between `set-all` and `force-all` is that
`set-all` actually changes the individual category settings while `force-all`
is a (temporary) override of those settings and does not change them.

[[log_options]]
=== Log printing options

The logging system has various options to change the information
displayed in the log message.

log color 1::
	With this option each log message will log with the color of its
	category. The color is hard-coded and can not be changed. As with
	other options a '0' disables this functionality.

log timestamp 1::
	Includes the current time in the log message. When logging to syslog
	this option should not be needed, but may come in handy when debugging
	an issue while logging to file.

log print extended-timestamp 1::
	In order to debug time-critical issues this option will print a
	timestamp with millisecond granularity.

log print category 1::
	Prefix each log message	with the category name.

log print category-hex 1::
	Prefix each log message	with the category number in hex ('<000b>').

log print level 1::
	Prefix each log message with the name of the log level.

log print file 1::
	Prefix each log message with the source file and line number. Append
	the keyword `last` to append the file information instead of prefixing
	it.

[[log_filters]]
=== Log filters

The default behavior is to filter out everything, i.e. not to
log anything.  The reason is quite simple: On a busy production setup,
logging all events for a given subsystem may very quickly be flooding
your console before you have a chance to set a more restrictive filter.

To request no filtering, i.e. see all messages, you may use:
  	`log filter all 1`

In addition to generic filtering, applications can implement special log filters using the same framework
to filter on particular context.

For example in OsmoBSC, to only see messages relating to a particular
subscriber identified by his IMSI, you may use:
	`log filter imsi 262020123456789`

=== Log targets

Each of the log targets represent certain destination for log messages.
It can be configured independently by selecting levels (see <<log_levels>>) for categories
(see <<log_categories>>) as well as filtering (see <<log_filters>>) and
other options like `logging timestamp` for example.

==== Logging to the VTY

Logging messages to the interactive command-line interface (VTY) is most
useful for occasional investigation by the system administrator.

Logging to the VTY is disabled by default, and needs to be enabled
explicitly for each such session.  This means that multiple concurrent
VTY sessions each have their own logging configuration.  Once you close
a VTY session, the log target will be destroyed and your log settings be
lost.  If you re-connect to the VTY, you have to again activate and
configure logging, if you wish.

To create a logging target bound to a VTY, you have to use the following
command: `logging enable` This doesn't really activate the
generation of any output messages yet, it merely creates and attaches a
log target to the VTY session.  The newly-created target still doesn't
have any filter installed, i.e.  __all log messages will be suppressed
by default__

Next, you can configure the log levels for desired categories in your VTY session.
See <<log_categories>> for more details on categories and <<log_levels>> for the log level details.

For example, to set the log level of the Call Control category to debug, you
can use:
  	`log level cc debug`

Finally, after having configured the levels, you still need to set the
filter as it's described in <<log_filters>>.

TIP: If many messages are being logged to a VTY session, it may be hard
to impossible to still use the same session for any commands.  We
therefore recommend to open a second VTY session in parallel, and use
one only for logging, while the other is used for interacting with the
system. Another option would be to use different log target.

To review the current vty logging configuration, you
can use:
  	`show logging vty`

==== Logging to the ring buffer

To avoid having separate VTY session just for logging output while still having immediate access to them,
one can use `alarms` target. It lets you store the log messages inside the ring buffer of a given size which
is available with `show alarms` command.

It's configured as follows:
----
OsmoBSC> enable
OsmoBSC# configure terminal
OsmoBSC(config)# log alarms 98
OsmoBSC(config-log)#
----

In the example above 98 is the desired size of the ring buffer (number of messages). Once it's filled,
the incoming log messages will push out the oldest messages available in the buffer.

==== Logging via gsmtap

GSMTAP is normally a pseudo-header format that enables the IP-transport of GSM (or other telecom) protocols
that are not normally transported over IP.  For example, the most common situation is to enable GSMTAP in
OsmoBTS or OsmoPCU to provide GSM-Um air interface capture files over IP, so they can be analyzed in
wireshark.

GSMTAP logging is now a method how Osmocom software can also encapsulate its own log output in GSMTAP frames.
We're not trying to re-invent rsyslog here, but this is very handy When debugging complex issues.  It enables
the reader of the pcap file containing GSMTAP logging together with other protocol traces to reconstruct exact
chain of events.  A single pcap file can then contain both the log output of any number of Osmocom programs in
the same timeline of the messages on various interfaces in and out of said Osmocom programs.

It's configured as follows:
----
OsmoBSC> enable
OsmoBSC# configure terminal
OsmoBSC(config)# log gsmtap 192.168.2.3 <1>
OsmoBSC(config-log)#
----
<1> Configure a GSMTAP logging target recording to 192.168.2.3

The hostname/ip argument is optional: if omitted the default 127.0.0.1 will be used. The log strings inside GSMTAP are already
supported by Wireshark. Capturing for `port 4729` on appropriate interface will reveal log messages including source file
name and line number as well as application. This makes it easy to consolidate logs from several different network components
alongside the air frames. You can also use Wireshark to quickly filter logs for a given subsystem, severity, file name etc.

The GSMTAP logging target also has different implementation I/O modes, which can
be configured during the VTY "log gmstap" VTY command:

nonblocking-io::
	Use non-blocking, synchronous I/O. This is the default mode. It will set
	the GSMTAP source socket as non-blocking, and attempt synchronous write
	to the UDP socket, discarding a message if the UDP socket's send buffer
	is full during write.
blocking-io::
	Use blocking, synchronous I/O. It will use the GSMTAP source socket in
	blocking mode, and attempt synchronous write to the UDP socket, blocking
	the entire thread if the UDP socket's send buffer is full during write.
	This I/O mode should not be used in any osmocom program driven by an
	event loop (which includes any program using a VTY), since it may block
	the thread for an unspecified (potentially long or even infinite)
	amount of time and hence prevent the event loop to run and process
	events. This I/O mode should only be used under specific circumstances,
	like debugging a crash, in which case it's interesting to get the
	logging output to the UDP socket and hence recorded before the program
	crashes.
wq::
	Workqueue mode: Use non-blocking, asynchronous I/O. It will set the
	GSMTAP source socket as non-blocking, and attempt asynchronous write to
	the UDP socket by means of a work queue driven by the process poll event
	loop, delaying writing to the UDP socket until there's enough free space
	in its send buffer. Since the workqueue has a maximum size, messages
	will be discarded similar to _nonblocking-io_ once the UDP socket's send
	buffer *and* the GSMTAP log target workqueue are full. This I/O mode
	provides some extra buffering space in the userspace workqueue, at the
	expense of extra overhead and delay to transmit messages asynchronously
	waiting for POLLOUT event from the UDP socket.

In any of the I/O modes above, the UDP socket send buffer size of the GSMTAP log
target influences where messages may be dropped (_nonblocking-io_|_wq_) or the
process blocked (_blocking-io_) whenever a high number of messages or test are
transmitted in a short time. For that reason, the GSMTAP log target will attempt
to set the `SO_SNDBUF` sockopt of the UDP socket to 4MB. In Linux, the
`SO_SNDBUF` value being set on the socket will be trimmed by the kernel to a
maximum allowed by sysctl `net.core.wmem_max`. Hence, if you want to be on a
safer side minimizing dropping messages or blocking the process (depending on
the I/O mode set), make sure sysctl `net.core.wmem_max` on your system is set to
`4194304` (4MB) or more.

NOTE: Linux Kernel used to have a `net.core.wmem_max` of `212992`(208KB) until
recently (2025, a6d4f25888b83b8300aef28d9ee22765c1cc9b34), where it was
increased to `4194304` (4MB) .

NOTE: Every time you generate GSMTAP messages and send it to a unicast (non-broadcast/multicast) IP address,
please make sure that the destination IP address actually has a socket open on the specified port, or drops
the packets in its packet filter.  If unicast GSMTAP messages arrive at a closed destination UDP port, the
operating system will likely generate ICMP port unreachable messages.  Those ICMP messages in turn will, when
arriving at the source (the host on which you run the Osmocom software sending GSMTAP), suppress generation
of further GSMTAP messages for some time, resulting in incomplete files.  In case of doubt, either send GSMTAP
to multicast IP addresses, or run something like `nc -l -u -p 4729 > /dev/null` on the destination host to
at the GSMTAP port and discard anything arriving at it.  If the GSMTAP recording address is identified as a
local address, upon creation of the GSMTAP log target, an attempt will be made to create a dummy sink socket
to avoid such problems automatically.

[[logging_file]]
==== Logging to a file

As opposed to Logging to the VTY, logging to files is persistent and
stored in the configuration file.  As such, it is configured in
sub-nodes below the configuration node.  There can be any number of log
files active, each of them having different settings regarding levels /
subsystems.

To configure a new log file, enter the following sequence of commands:
----
OsmoBSC> enable
OsmoBSC# configure terminal
OsmoBSC(config)# log file /path/to/my/file <1>
OsmoBSC(config-log)#
----
<1> Configure a file logging target writing to /path/to/my/file

This leaves you at the config-log prompt, from where you can set the
detailed configuration for this log file.  The available commands at
this point are identical to configuring logging on the VTY, they include
`logging filter`, `logging level` as well as `logging color`
and `logging timestamp`.

The file logging target will by default use a synchronous non-blocking I/O
write. If writing cannot be performed synchronously (would block), the message
is stored in a workqueue where asynchronous write (driven by poll event loop)
will be performed at a later stage. The file logging target can be configured
during the VTY `log file` VTY command to perform blocking I/O with the
`blocking-io` parameter. This I/O mode should not be used in any osmocom program
driven by an event loop (which includes any program using a VTY), since it may
block the thread for an unspecified (potentially long or even infinite) amount
of time and hence prevent the event loop to run and process events. This I/O
mode should only be used under specific circumstances, like debugging a crash,
in which case it's interesting to get the logging output to the UDP socket and
hence recorded before the program crashes.

TIP: Don't forget to use the `copy running-config startup-config` (or
its short-hand `write file`) command to make your logging configuration
persistent across application re-start.

NOTE: libosmocore provides file close-and-reopen support by SIGHUP, as used by
popular log file rotating solutions such as https://github.com/logrotate/logrotate
found in most GNU/Linux distributions.


==== Logging to syslog

syslog is a standard for computer data logging maintained by the IETF.
Unix-like operating systems like GNU/Linux provide several syslog
compatible log daemons that receive log messages generated by
application programs.

libosmocore based applications can log messages to syslog by using the
syslog log target.  You can configure syslog logging by issuing the
following commands on the VTY:

----
OsmoBSC> enable
OsmoBSC# configure terminal
OsmoBSC(config)# log syslog daemon
OsmoBSC(config-log)#
----

This leaves you at the config-log prompt, from where you can set the
detailed configuration for this log file.  The available commands at
this point are identical to configuring logging on the VTY, they include
`logging filter`, `logging level` as well as `logging color`
and `logging timestamp`.

NOTE: Syslog daemons will normally automatically prefix every message
with a time-stamp, so you should disable the libosmocore time-stamping
by issuing the `logging timestamp 0` command.


==== Logging to systemd-journal

systemd has been adopted by the majority of modern GNU/Linux distributions.
Along with various daemons and utilities it provides systemd-journald [1] -
a daemon responsible for event logging (syslog replacement).  libosmocore
based applications can log messages directly to systemd-journald.

The key difference from other logging targets is that systemd based logging
allows to offload rendering of the meta information, such as location
(file name, line number), subsystem, and logging level, to systemd-journald.
Furthermore, systemd allows to attach arbitrary meta fields to the logging
messages [2], which can be used for advanced log filtering.

[1] https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-journald.service.html
[2] https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.journal-fields.html

It was decided to introduce libsystemd as an optional dependency,
so it needs to be enabled explicitly at configure/build time:

----
$ ./configure --enable-systemd-logging
----

NOTE: Recent libosmocore packages provided by Osmocom for Debian and CentOS are
compiled *with* libsystemd (https://gerrit.osmocom.org/c/libosmocore/+/22651).

You can configure systemd based logging in two ways:

.Example: `systemd-journal` target with offloaded rendering
----
log systemd-journal raw <1>
 logging filter all 1
 logging level set-all notice
----
<1> `raw` logging handler, rendering offloaded to systemd.

In this example, logging messages will be passed to systemd without any meta
information (time, location, level, category) in the text itself, so all
the printing parameters like `logging print file` will be ignored.  Instead,
the meta information is passed separately as _fields_ which can be retrieved
from the journal and rendered in any preferred way.

----
# Show Osmocom specific fields
$ journalctl --fields | grep OSMO

# Filter messages by logging subsystem at run-time
$ journalctl OSMO_SUBSYS=DMSC -f

# Render specific fields only
$ journalctl --output=verbose \
	--output-fields=SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER,OSMO_SUBSYS,CODE_FILE,CODE_LINE,MESSAGE
----

See `man 7 systemd.journal-fields` for a list of default fields, and
`man 1 journalctl` for general information and available formatters.

.Example: `systemd-journal` target with libosmocore based rendering
----
log systemd-journal <1>
 logging filter all 1
 logging print file basename
 logging print category-hex 0
 logging print category 1
 logging print level 1
 logging timestamp 0 <2>
 logging color 1 <3>
 logging level set-all notice
----
<1> Generic logging handler, rendering is done by libosmocore.
<2> Disable timestamping, systemd will timestamp every message anyway.
<3> Colored messages can be rendered with `journalctl --output=cat`.

In this example, logging messages will be pre-processed by libosmocore before
being passed to systemd.  No additional fields will be attached, except the
logging level (`PRIORITY`).  This mode is similar to _syslog_ and _stderr_.


==== Logging to stderr

If you're not running the respective application as a daemon in the
background, you can also use the stderr log target in order to log to
the standard error file descriptor of the process.

In order to configure logging to stderr, you can use the following
commands:
----
OsmoBSC> enable
OsmoBSC# configure terminal
OsmoBSC(config)# log stderr
OsmoBSC(config-log)#
----

The stderr logging target can be configured during the VTY `log stderr` VTY
command to perform blocking I/O with the `blocking-io` parameter. See
<<logging_file>> for more information.
